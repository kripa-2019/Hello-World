# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# azure-pipelines-trigger.yml

# this pipeline will be triggered by another pipeline
resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: previous-pipeline-trigger   # Name of the pipeline resource
    source: First-Pipeline-yaml # Name of the pipeline referenced by the pipeline resource
    project: Trigger-Pipeline-From-Another-Pipeline # Required only if the source pipeline is in another project
    trigger: true # enable the trigger

pool:
